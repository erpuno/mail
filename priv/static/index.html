        <div>Open source lightweight Messaging Handling Service (MHS X.419)
             and Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS X.420).
             MHS was a very open system, it was popular in the
             early 1990s as a glue between proprietary
             email systems, competing standards-based SMTP and X.400.
             However, by 1996 it was clear that SMTP over the Internet
             would take over this role. However MHS/IPMS is a faster
             and has more telecomunication flavour than SMTP track of standards.
             Now MHS is used in avionics and in Military Message Handling
             System (MMHS, RFC 6477).</div>
