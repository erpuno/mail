SYNRC ✉️ MAIL
=============

Open source lightweight Messaging Handling Service (MHS X.419)
and Interpersonal Messaging System (IPMS X.420).
MHS was a very open system, it was popular in the
early 1990s as a glue between proprietary
email systems, competing standards-based SMTP and X.400.
However, by 1996 it was clear that SMTP over the Internet
would take over this role. However MHS/IPMS is a faster
and has more telecomunication flavour than SMTP track of standards.
Now MHS is used in avionics and in Military Message Handling
System (MMHS, RFC 6477).
